# instagrambot
Simple Instagram bot that automatically gets followers counts, accounts that don't follow back, recent unfollowers, and can like recent posts 
of a specified account to get interaction and a follow back.

Due to instagram no longer supporting API's this is a work around using a python library Selenium to find html elements to navigate through instagram and perform
actions. However it is not fast and very combersume to work with.
